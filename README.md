# Shopping List App

This is a simple iOS application for managing your shopping list. Users can add, edit, delete items, mark items as bought/not bought, and search for items.

## Important Notes

For data persistence, the app uses Swift Data framework. However, to comply with the task requirements, the Swift Data implementation has been placed on a separate branch named "swift-data". Please review this branch for the Swift Data integration. The main branch contains the solution that adheres to the specified requirements.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add new items to the shopping list using the add button on the top left.
- **Edit Items**: Users can edit existing items in the shopping list by selecting an item and edit it in the edit item view.

- **Mark as Bought**: Users can mark items as bought, indicating that they have been purchased.
- **Mark as Not Bought**: Users can mark items as not bought, indicating that they have not been purchased yet.
- **Switch Between Bought/Not Bought**: Users can switch between bought/not bought items, using the Bought Items toggle.
- **Search**: Users can search for items in the shopping list based on their names/descriptions.
- **Sort Ascedingly/Desendingly**: Users can sort items ascendingly/descendingly based on the items quantites.
